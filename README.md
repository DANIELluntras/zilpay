```{
 datasource={
  actions:
  {
    iconClass: "class for icon",
    classCss: " class what you need to maipulate in DOM",
    method: " a function "
  },
  editable: "If you want the table be editable: true/false",
  data for table { ES 6 } ...dataTable
}
```

2. In html template you need to declare

```
<elix-table [dataSource] ="data at you initialized in ngOnInit">
  <elix-column-text className="what class css you want for this column"
  [iconClass]="Optional"
  field="column from table"
  name="what name you want to do"> ...
  <elix-column-area-text require !!!  field name > ...
</elix-table>
```

# and enjoy at this beautiful library

## Angular Json

Add all file from bootstrap such as style

## Tsconfig.app.json

I added some property new such as

#### strictPropertyInitialization : true

which we don't need it anymore to initialization evry property

##### Add The @HostListener and @HostBinding

With the HostBinding we can access either one element.
e.g
@HostBinding('style.backgroundColor') backgroundColor: string = 'color' (must to be initialized this parameter)

### For run test cypress
